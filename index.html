		<h1>Personal</h1>
		<p>My name is Andrew Tapp, but my friends and family all call me Avi. My wife's name is Adina, and I currently have the (exhausting) pleasure of raising our 12-year-old daughter Naamah and our baby son Chaim Shaul. We all live in Buffalo for now, while Naamah finishes school. My patient wife focuses on our family while I focus on everything else. I like to read, play World of Warcraft, program, build websites, watch TEDtalks, go hiking, and in general learn about and try new things. I'm a different guy every day, and I try to be a <i>better</i> guy each following day. If you are ever in the Buffalo, NY, USA area and have a couple hours to spare, find a local Starbucks, and send me a message either by email, text, or flying pidgeon. I love hearing about other people's stories and how they got to be where they are today.</p>

		<h1>Professional</h1>
		<p>As I said on the left side, my name is Andrew Tapp, but I prefer Avi. I started my college education in SUNY New Paltz, continued on to SUNY Ulster, and finished at SUNY @ Buffalo State College. I'm finishing my Independent Study degree in Public Communications after changing through several majors including, but not in order; Secondary Education (Earth Science, Spanish, Math), Psychology, Sociology, Special Education, and Public Relations. PR is my final major, although I would probably have spent some time in Advertising if I stuck around. I'm currently working by doing free-lance web design projects, while learning Python and sharpening my HTML/CSS skills.</p>
