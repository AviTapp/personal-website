personal-website
==================

   This is my personal website. It will have a description about who I am, as
well as my portfolio, my resume, and several ways of contacting me. Anybody who
reads this README file, or gets a chance to browse my website via GitHub, please
get in touch with me regarding any problems, improvements, or criticisms about
the website or also any project ideas you have for me.

I also like being hired! :)
